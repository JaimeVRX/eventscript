- [ESX Framework](https://github.com/esx-framework/esx_core)
- Notifications: `CodePlazaNotify` (customizable)
- Discord webhook (optional)

## 📂 Setup

1. Add both client & server code to your resource.
2. Set your Discord webhook URL in `server.lua`:
   ```lua
   local webhook = 'your_webhook_here'
   ```
3. Add the resource to your `server.cfg`.

---

## 🔐 Permissions

By default, only players with one of these jobs can start/stop events:

```lua
local staffJobs = {'admin', 'moderator', 'staff'}
```

You can edit the list in `server.lua`.

## 📡 Webhook Example

Your Discord webhook will receive embed logs like:

```

```
